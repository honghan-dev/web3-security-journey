## Medium findings

1. [Attackers can force swaps on other users' wallets who have trusted the keepers to close their loans](https://cantina.xyz/code/050711ca-a6d1-4fdd-9f94-3816233c1bd5/findings/294)

- Attacker can send NFT which is close to expiry to another user with keeper function enabled, forcefully swapping their tokens and reducing their token approval to keeper, eventually cause their own closeLoan function to fail.

2. [forecloseLoan() does not handle a scenario where cashAvailable is 0 leading to revert on Uniswap SwapRouter](https://cantina.xyz/code/050711ca-a6d1-4fdd-9f94-3816233c1bd5/findings/182)

- Uniswap swap function will revert if swapping with 0 amount, hence `forecloseLoan` function can't be called.

3. [Price manipulation vulnerability in LoansNFT.forecloseLoan enables escrow owners to extract borrower refunds](https://cantina.xyz/code/050711ca-a6d1-4fdd-9f94-3816233c1bd5/findings/81)

- Borrower: Has defaulted on loan, has remaining funds to be returned
- Attacker: Escrow supplier who has right to foreclose
- Escrow supplier can call `forecloseLoan` filling the swapParameter with 0 minAmountOut(no slippage protection)
- View as medium because of the low likelihood for it to be profitable.

### Low findings

1. [Asymmetric and Unbalanced Settlement Calculation](https://cantina.xyz/code/050711ca-a6d1-4fdd-9f94-3816233c1bd5/findings/343)

- The protocol's settlement logic uses absolute price differences instead of proportional changes, causing unequal outcomes between equivalent percentage price movements (e.g., 2x up vs 0.5x down). While this creates mathematical asymmetry, it's considered a low-severity issue as providers can actively manage risk by adjusting their strike prices and offer terms.
