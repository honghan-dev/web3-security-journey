### Questions to ask during/after each audit

1. Don't know what to look for
2. Not focus enough
3. Missing bugs/vulnerability  
4. Not able to find bugs/vulnerability (lack of experience)
5. Not taking good notes

1. **Commit more hours.**
I'm huge believer of Malcom Gladwell's 10,000 hours rules. The best way to improve is to invest more time into auditing. Looking at different codebase, different DeFi protocols. After spending more time then we discover what our strength and weakness is, what area should we improve and how do we audit a codebase more efficiencyly. 

2. Develope good feedback system
Getting good feedback is the best way to improve, that includes going through more codebase, projects/protocol, reading more bug/vulnerability reports

3. Focus on understanding the codebase
It is more important to understand a section of the codebase completely, than going through all the codebase but didn't understand it properly.
