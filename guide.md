# Notes on how I improve as a Web3 Security Researcher

1. Commit More Hours
Malcolm Gladwell’s [**10,000 hour rule**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4662388/) — mastery comes from consistent, focused effort.
Spend more time auditing, reading technical documents, listening to podcast

2. Focus on Understanding the Codebase
Instead of skimming everything, I aim to deeply understand core components. Quality over quantity — real insights come from depth, not just coverage.

3. Learn by Doing
Theory only goes so far. Every audit, real or practice, teaches more than reading alone. I improve fastest when I apply, break, and fix things hands-on.

4. Develop a Feedback Loop
Constantly review past audits, compare my findings with top reports, and analyze what I missed. Learning from gaps is the fastest way to level up.
