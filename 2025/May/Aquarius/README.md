# [Aquarius](https://github.com/AquaToken/soroban-amm)

This is the AMM protocol built on Stellar smart contract platform (Soroban) that allows spinning up 2 types of pools: volatile (inspired by Uniswap V2) and stable (inspired by Curve), as well as swapping assets in these pools including multihop routes where assetA is swapped into assetC with 2 swaps A=>B and B=>C in case A/C pool does not exist.
